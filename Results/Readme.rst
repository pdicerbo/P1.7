P1.7 results
============================
In this report I will present the results of the benchmarks done during the P1.7 course.
In the first part I show the tests done with different libraries (Intel MKL and OpenBLAS) and the performances obtained from three different functions.
Then I switch into the test of the DSYEV function on different machines to test scaling properties of the ScaLAPACK, PLASMA and MAGMA libraries.
